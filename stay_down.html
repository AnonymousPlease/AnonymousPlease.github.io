        You shut your eyes against the bright afternoon light and try to recall something, anything. Your head throbs with the effort, but you are rewarded with the whisper of a memory "...Jay, go..." and suddenly, almost blinding darkness explodes and pain shoots through your shoulder. You gasp, your eyes snapping open and the connection breaking.
        </p>
        <p>
        "What the hell was that...?" you think, massaging your shoulder gingerly. What's going through your mind?
