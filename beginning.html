    <h1>Welcome to the beginning of the story</h1>
        <p>
        Hi, I'm, your narrator. I'll be dictating the story, and I suppose that might come across as a little strange, but you'll probably get used to it!
        </p>
        <p>
        Oh, the story- That's why you're here! Right, so. The beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
        You're lying on your back, disoriented, and man does your head hurt. What do you want to do?
